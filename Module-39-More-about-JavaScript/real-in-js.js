/* 
What really is JavaScript?
-> JavaScript is highly abstracted programming language.
    High Abstraction
    an abstraction is a way
    -> hiding the implementation details
    -> showing only the functionality to the users
    For example: ATM Machine 
    Step 1 : Hide details = User does not know what happening inside the ATM
    Step 2 : Show functionality = He is simply getting the money by pushing button. 
    High Abstraction in JavaScript
        -> We don't have to handle resources management and memory allocation
        -> We don't have to handle garbage collection
        -> Reduces details so that developers can focus on logic batter
        -> Improve understandability as well as maintainability of code
    JavaScript collects garbage automatically
-> JavaScript is a JIT compiled languages
    a. interpreted languages like as apple. no need to process 
    b. compiled language like as kodu. need process
    JIT means Just in Time compile
    -> JavaScript is not a purely interpreted language
    -> Modern JavaScript is JIT compiled
    -> JIT compiler convert the JS entire code to machine code and execute them immediately

    Process of JS Code execution
    Load JS File in Browser --> Parsing --> Abstract Tree --> JIT compiled --> if needed Optimized Code --> Execution

-> JavaScript is a multi paradigm programming language.
    Paradigm : code structure that will determine the style or a way of programming.
    1. Procedural Programming 2. Object Oriented Programming 3. Functional Programming

-> JavaScript is a proto-typed based programming language

-> JavaScript is a dynamically typed programming language
